	  I am very passionate about Web Development. I want to become a Full Stack Developer in my future.
	  I have learned computer languages like C#, Java, C, C++ with object oriented programming in my past years. I have started learning Web Development one year ago. I have learnt HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, JavaScript. Now I am learning Web Backend Development with C#, Node.JS, Angular & SQL Database Languages.
	  I am very passionate about technology eager to learn & develop such useful things for my community and people. I am from an area where there is no technology and people are living in very difficult life & I wish to create a center of development & technology in my area. I really want to learn something to serve mankind in any way possible and this is the sole reason why technology has always excited me.
